* Blood in the feces 
* Mucus in the feces 
* Depression 
* Ruffled feathers 
* Pale skin 
* Weight loss 

### Transmission
* Coccidiosis is transmitted through the oral-fecal route.
* Infected birds excrete oocysts, which are the infective stage of the parasite, in their droppings.
* Oocysts can be found in litter, clothes, shoes, dust, and insects.

### Control
* Vaccination 
* Preventative medication 
* Good management practices 
* Reducing parasite load 
* Disinfectants like steam cleaning, boiling water, or a 10% ammonia solution 

### Prevention
* Healthy chickens build up immunity to the parasite, which prevents infection.
